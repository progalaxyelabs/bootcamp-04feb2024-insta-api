Live demo session on Feb 06, 2024 as part of Free Bootcamp on Web Development.

During the 50 minute live demo, participants witnessed how to use Node Express JS as a backend to server posts data to  frontend.

Run `npm install` to get the node packages and then run `node index.js` to start the development server which starts on port 3000. You can check if the server is running from browser using `http://localhost:3000`

If you have any other node servers running in paraller, port 3000 might not be available in which case, node will ask you if you want to start on a different port. Use that port in the web browser and in the frontend instead of 3000.

This is the final code as of end of the demo session at 7PM IST
